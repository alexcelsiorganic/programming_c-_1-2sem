CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:16 (message):
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH is not defined, you may need to set it
  (-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="path/to/Qt/lib/cmake" or
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr/include/{host}/qt{version}/ on Ubuntu)


CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:20 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindQt6.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "Qt6", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Qt6" with any of
  the following names:

    Qt6Config.cmake
    qt6-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "Qt6" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "Qt6_DIR"
  to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "Qt6" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
